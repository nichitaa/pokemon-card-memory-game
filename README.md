### Architecture brief description

Actual game logic is defined in [`Game`](./src/game/game.ts) class and powered by RxJS streams.
This allows to decouple the logic from client framework/library, therefore it is framework-agnostic
and can be used with Angular, Vue, React, vanilla etc. The only `peerDependency` is RxJS. I believe this a flexible
yet structured approach that allows to develop on further feature-sets with ease.

The game "state" is very minimalistic and consists of:

- list of pokemons (`cards$`)
- game status (`#status$`)
- configurations (`matchLimit$` and `groupLimit$`) to control number of pokemon variants and number of cards to match

### Used libraries

Build with React, Typescript and ViteJS

- RxJS (drives the application state)
- [`shadcn-ui`](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui), `tailwind`, `@radix-ui` - this pack comes in combination, I wanted to
  try `shadcn-ui` as I knew it gained a lot of community popularity and involvement, so this is my first try with this
  tool.
- `observable-hooks` - basic RxJS bindings for React

### What needs to be improved

- add player customization (e.g.: name) and track scores per player
- add game modes (e.g.: play with customized timer)
- UI, even if it is responsive, it can be extended and made more beautiful and informative (e.g.: add stats for
  pokemons)
- Technically, it is possible to improve in a lot of places, validate API response (add `zod`), define "error states" on
  UI, clean-up styles and combine tailwind classes into reusable parts (e.g.: typographies)...

### What would be next steps

- Besides above, I'd like to make the game "service" agnostic, use it with some predefined image services (not only
  pokemons or cats)
